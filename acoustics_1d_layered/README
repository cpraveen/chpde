Acoustic waves propagating in a layered medium, as shown in Figures 9.8 and 9.9.

The transmission-based limiter of Fogarty and LeVeque is used when mylim=1
in setprob.data.  This works better than the standard limiter, and is
implemented in trlimit.f as called from step1.f (a modified version of this
library routine is in this directory).

WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
