Variable coefficient advection equation -- conservative advection equation
Traffic flow example.  

The velocity u(x) in cell i is stored in aux(i,1) and is set in setaux.
The velocity is piecewise constant with a jump at x=0.

Two different Riemann solvers rp1advcon.f and rp1adv3.f can be compared.


Plot the trajectories of cars (as in Figure 9.3) using trackcars.m


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
