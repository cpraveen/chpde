# Computational Hyperbolic PDE

These codes are based on Clawpack and the book 

R. J. LeVeque, Finite volume methods for hyperbolic problems, CUP.

To install Clawpack, see the instructions here

http://cpraveen.github.io/comp/clawpack.html

Directory `book` contains original codes used for the book; they will not work with latest clawpack, you need to use v4.3 but I do not recommend this. Many of the codes have been converted here
