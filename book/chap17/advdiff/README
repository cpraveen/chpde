Advection-diffusion equation solved with a fractional step method.
The diffusion equation is solved in src1.f using Crank-Nicolson.
The tridiagonal system is solved using the LAPACK routine in
tridiag.f.

The advection velocity u and diffusion coefficient dcoef are set in
setprob.data.  

afterframe.m computes and plots the exact solution along with the computed
solution.


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
