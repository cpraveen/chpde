Solution to Burgers' equation with a stiff source term,
  psi(u) = u*(1-u)*(u-beta)/tau

The values of beta and tau are set in setprob.data, along with iode,
which specifies what ODE solver to use for the source term (see setprob.f).




WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
