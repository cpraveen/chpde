Advection-reaction equation with a fractional step method
  q_t + q_x = -(1-x)q

Set up for comparing accuracy of different methods as shown in Figure 17.3

In directory qref do  ../xclaw  
  to create reference solution

Follow directions in makefig.m to compare results for different methods.



WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
