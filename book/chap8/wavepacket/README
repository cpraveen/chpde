Solve the advection equation on [0,1] with periodic boundary conditions
and compare the computed solution with the exact solution at integer values
of t.  The error in the infinity- and 1-norm are computed.

Tabulated values of these errors from different runs (adjusting mx in
claw1ez.data) are collected in errors.m, which produces the log-log plots 
shown in Figure 8.2.


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
