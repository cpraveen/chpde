The upwind method is used to solve the advection equation.
The resulting solution is compared to the exact solution of the modified
equation, as shown in Figure 8.3.  This is computed in afterframe.m.


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
