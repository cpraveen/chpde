Burgers' equation solved with a nonconservative upwind method,
to demonstrate that this does not approximate the weak solution properly.
This is implemented in rp1noncon.f

The standard Riemann solver for Burgers' equation is in rp1bu.f

Compile using 
  make -f Makefile.conservative
to get this one.


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
