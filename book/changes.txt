Changes to claw/book

4/06

Updated to work with latest m-files in Version 4.2 or 4.3 of CLAWPACK.



1/12/04

Warnings added to README files that the local m-files are not compatible with
the new matlab routines in Version 4.2 of CLAWPACK.  Instead the old files in
claw/matlab41 should be used in conjunction with the new version.

claw/book/chap7/advinflow
  claw1ez.data: method(5) = 0   (was set to 1 but default src1.f routine was
                                  used so no source term was implemented)
  setprob.data:  two lines eliminated that were not used.
  README file added.


claw/book/chap22/inclusion
  afterframe.m:  z = double(z)   added to convert logical array to double,
