Elasticity equations in a thin plate

The elastic parameters are defined in setprob.data
Elastic parameters in each cell are set in setaux.f

The wave is generated by motion of the left boundary, specified in bc2.f
using parameters defined in setprob.data.   No-stress boundary conditions
are imposed at the top, bottom, and right boundaries.

The matlab plotting style is specified in setplot2.m
The UserVariableFile  sigmatr.m  computes the trace of sigma, and is invoked
if UserVariable==1, otherwise component mq of the solution is plotted.

The afterframe.m file also plots the deformation as a mesh plot (as in
Figure 22.4), amplifying the computed deformation by a factor dd.
The deformation is computed by integrating the velocity field in each time
step.  The deformation is stored in aux(..6) and aux(..7) and is written out
to aux.aXXXX in the modified out2.f routine in this directory.


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
