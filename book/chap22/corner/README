Elasticity equations in a region consisting of two materials with a corner.

mx=400, my=400 was used for the plots in the book.

The elastic parameters are defined in setprob.data
and the inclusion geometry is specified by fdisc.f
Elastic parameters in each cell are set in setaux.f

The wave is generated by specifying a right-going P-wave in qinit.f

The matlab plotting style is specified in setplot2.m
The UserVariableFile  sigmatr.m  computes the trace of sigma, and is invoked
if UserVariable==1, otherwise component mq of the solution is plotted.


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
