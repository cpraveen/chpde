Traffic flow equations, with a bulge in density.

Currently set up to output frequently in order to 
create a plot of characteristics via contour plot in x-t plane

After running xclaw, type plotclaw1xt in matlab to produce the 
x-t contour plot.


Reduce the frequency of output in claw1ex.data if you just want to watch the
solution evolve in time.


traffic.m solves the ODEs to track the motion of individual cars


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
