This directory contains a modified limiter.f function which implements the
TVB method of Shu as an extension of the second-order minmod method.

The value of M, set in setprob.data, should be chosen as an approximation to
q_{xx} at the extrema to be captured.   The grid should be fine enough that 
M*dx is small or the method will be dispersive.  

For the wave-packet problem used here, you might experiment with
  M = 6500 or other values 
  different resolutions, such as 400 or 800 points
  different limiters besides minmod (which may work poorly!)
   

WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
