Radial dam-break problem for 2D shallow water equations.

Subdirectory 1drad contains code to solve 1d radially symmetric equations
on a fine grid.  First run this code.

After running 2d code, with same set of output times as in 1drad,
you can compare a scatter plot of the 2d results with the 1d results by
setting PlotType=4 in plotclaw2.

WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
