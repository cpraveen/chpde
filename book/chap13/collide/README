1d Shallow water equations with initial data consisting of two 2-shocks,
which collide and produce a 1-rarefaction and 2-shock.

The initial data is set in qinit.f

The states in the phase plane (Figure 13.18) are computed and plotted in
collide.m


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
