Variable coefficient advection equation -- nonconservative color equation

The velocity u(x) in cell i is stored in aux(i,1) and is set in setaux.

The initial data in qinit consists of a smooth hump with parameters set in
setprob.data, and square pulse.

In matlab, the true solution on a grid determined by x is computed in
computetrue.m   (and plotted by plottrue.m).   This uses ode45 to trace the
characteristics and produces the solution at a set of times specified in
tspan.   The velocity specified in xprime.m should be the negative of the
velocity u(x) specified in setaux (since we trace backwards along
characteristics).   The function used to compute q0 in computetrue should be
consistent with the data set in qinit.   

The function computetrue.m is called in afterframe.m.
This can be deleted to suppress this comparison with the true solution.
