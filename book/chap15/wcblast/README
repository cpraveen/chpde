Euler equations with colliding blast waves
(Woodward-Colella test problem) also called the "bang-bang problem".

To plot a comparison of fine and coarse grid solutions,
first run code in subdirectory qref, then in main directory.
The afterframe command calls plotqref.m,  to plot the reference solution
and compute the error based on finer grid solution in qref:

 make
 cd qref
 ../xclaw
 cd ..
 xclaw
 matlab
 plotclaw1


To use the HLLE solver instead of the Roe solver, switch to rp1euhlle.f and
rp1euhlle.o in Makefile.  You must also change mwaves from 3 to 2 in both
driver.f and claw1ez.data.


To produce the x-t plot of Figure 15.4:

 make
 cd xtplot
 ../xclaw
 matlab
 plotxt


WARNING: This example was modified February, 2006 to use
Version 4.3 of clawpack and the associated matlab scripts.
